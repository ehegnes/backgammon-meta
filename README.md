Backgammon
==========

This project aims to provide a web-based backgammon game. The server is to be
in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). The client is to use
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). All logic is to be contained in a
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) library and used via Foreign Function
Interfaces.

# Server
- Use a module to declare types that will be shared with the client
